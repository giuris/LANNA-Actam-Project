## Introduction
As a project for the Advanced Coding Tools and Methodologies course we decide to create an educational keyboard that helps young students to learn the basics of notes and chords. 

Our keyboard can be played directly with your computer keys or using the mouse. Regarding to the minimal layout, we created it using Photoshop and Pixelmator.

In the upper part of the interface there is a screen in which animations will appear when the keys are pressed. In order to show to the user how a triad is composed, we create four buttons “MAJOR TRIAD, MINON TRIAD, AUGMENTED TRIAD, DIMINISHED TRIAD” that allows you to hear and see which notes make the triad chosen.

# INTERFACE

## Layout 
The  minimal layout presents the buttons NOTE and FREQ which have been created with Photoshop, while the piano keys and the logo “LANNA-GMA™” have been created with Pixelmator.
We obtained the background using the gradient fading property of the CSS programming language. 

# TECHNOLOGIES USED
This web application has been realized with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages and, thanks to the use of the Brackets editor, we were able to write every part of the code and collect everything here on GitHub.


# FEATURES

### NOTE button
Pressing the NOTE button you will be able to see the animations of the notes that you are playing on the right of the display. 
Pressing the button it changes its color, from blue (unpressed) to red.

Here is an example:

### FREQ button
The FREQ button allows to see the swing of the pure tone related to the played note to the left of the screen. In fact, every note has its related frequency, and the graph shows a different sinusoid for each one.
Like the NOTE button, Pressing the FREQ one it changes its color, from blue (unpressed) to red.

Here is an example:

###### Other features
- When NOTE and FREQ modes are enabled, the user is able to see both the animations of the played notes and their frequencies on the display of the keyboard. 

### Chords
a


# INTERACTIVE MENU
The application has an animated menu in which, by clicking on it, we find the items Tutorial, Example and Contacts.

In Tutorial there is a simple explanation of how to play and what the various buttons do.

The Example section shows a simple description of what a triad is and explains how to make simple chords.

In the end, by clicking on Contacts it is possible to reach us out.


# CONCLUSION
This project may have several additional features if developed over time, like the MIDI support, the possibility to change the frequency range and adding potentiometers and new scales.

For now, it has the basis to become a usable application in schools to teach the fundamentals of music theory, and the ideal would be to install this software on each student's computer!
