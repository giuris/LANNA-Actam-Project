## Introduction
As a project for the Advanced Coding Tools and Methodologies course we decide to create an educational keyboard that helps young students to learn the basics of notes and chords. 

Our keyboard can be played directly with your computer keys or using the mouse. Regarding to the minimal layout, we created it using Photoshop and Pixelmator.

In the upper part of the interface there is a screen in which animations will appear when the keys are pressed. In order to show to the user how a triad is composed, we create four buttons “MAJOR TRIAD, MINON TRIAD, AUGMENTED TRIAD, DIMINISHED TRIAD” that allows you to hear and see which notes make the triad chosen.

## Layout 
The  minimal layout presents the buttons NOTE and FREQ which have been created with Photoshop, while the piano keys and the logo “LANNA-GMA™” have been created with Pixelmator.
We obtained the background using the gradient fading property of the CSS programming language. 

# TECHNOLOGIES USED
This web application has been realized with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages and, thanks to the use of the Brackets editor, we were able to write every part of the code.
